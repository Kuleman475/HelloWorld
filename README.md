# Overview

# I am trying to expound my learning while retaining some of the programming languages that I do know. for me if I don't keep up on the languages I have knowledge in I will forget and lose touch and have to relearn it again.


# This program is a web page that dynamically puts in "Hello World" into the HTML using Javascript. using CSS I am able to make it a dark background and the text in white and make the words "Hello World" grow bigger and shrink back to normal size 3 times.

# My purpose for creating this software is to make sure that vs code is running and working like it should be but also for me to stay freshened up on programming languages and using Javascript to dynamically add to a web page.

# Development Environment

# I used VS code to develop the page.

# I used a combination of HTML, CSS, and Javascript to produce the page.
